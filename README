# Spring Webhook Solver

Spring Boot app that:
- On startup calls `generateWebhook`.
- Gets `webhook` + `accessToken`.
- Solves SQL Question 1 (since regNo ends with odd digit).
- Submits final SQL query with Authorization header.

## Final SQL Query (Q1)
```sql
SELECT p.AMOUNT AS SALARY,
       CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) AS NAME,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, e.DOB, CURDATE()) AS AGE,
       d.DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM PAYMENTS p
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) <> 1
  AND p.AMOUNT = (
    SELECT MAX(AMOUNT)
    FROM PAYMENTS
    WHERE DAY(PAYMENT_TIME) <> 1
  );
